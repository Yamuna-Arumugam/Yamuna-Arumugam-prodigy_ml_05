To develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, we'll use deep learning techniques. We'll build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for food recognition and a separate regression model for calorie estimation. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of food images with corresponding labels and calorie information. You can use existing food image datasets like Food-101 or compile your own dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation if needed. Additionally, extract features from the images to estimate calorie content.
3. **Model Architecture**:
   - For food recognition, we'll use a CNN architecture.
   - For calorie estimation, we'll use a regression model. This could be a simple neural network with dense layers.
4. **Model Training**: Train the food recognition CNN and the regression model for calorie estimation using the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models' performance on a separate test set to assess their accuracy in both food recognition and calorie estimation.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained models as an application or integrate them into existing platforms to enable users to upload food images and receive estimates of both food item and calorie content.

Below is a Python code example using TensorFlow and Keras for building the food recognition CNN and a simple regression model for calorie estimation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Food Recognition CNN
def food_recognition_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

# Calorie Estimation Regression Model
def calorie_estimation_model(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer for regression
    ])
    return model

# Define input shapes and number of classes
input_shape = (224, 224, 3)  # Adjust according to your image dimensions
num_classes = 10  # Example: 10 food categories

# Create and compile the food recognition model
food_model = food_recognition_model(input_shape, num_classes)
food_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Create and compile the calorie estimation model
calorie_model = calorie_estimation_model(input_shape)
calorie_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['mae'])
```

You'll need to train these models using your dataset, and then you can use them to recognize food items and estimate their calorie content. Ensure your dataset is appropriately labeled with food categories and corresponding calorie information for accurate training
